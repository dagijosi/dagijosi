## 🔥 What I’m Working On

### 🌐 **Website Builder**
I’m developing a **React-based website builder** that allows users to create fully responsive websites through an intuitive **drag-and-drop interface**. This project includes features such as resizable components, customizable element properties (padding, margins, etc.), and the ability to export **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** code. My goal is to empower users to build web pages without needing to write code, while offering advanced customization for developers.

### 🗺️ **Coffee Suppliers Dashboard**
I'm currently building a **Coffee Suppliers Dashboard** that provides real-time information about coffee suppliers, farms, and their locations on an interactive map. Using **React** for the UI and **Leaflet** for map rendering, this tool enables users to track farms, view details about coffee production, and monitor the status of various coffee suppliers. The app offers advanced filtering and a clean, modern UI using **TailwindCSS**.
